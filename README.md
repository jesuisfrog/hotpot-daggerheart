**Cookbook**: durante el **downtime**, anotarán cada receta que preparen, incluyendo su **nombre**, **ingredientes**, método de cocción y cómo quedó.

**Ingredient** An ingredient has **1–3 flavors**. Every flavor is linked to a specific **die size**, and **strength** that determines how many of that die the players roll when cooking with the ingredient.

**Downtime Move: Make a Feast**. The PCs who choose to Make a Feast should decide which ingredients they’re using, then erase those ingredients from their inventory
Then set a name and description for the dish and record it in their party’s **Cookbook**.

When the PCs begin cooking, they roll the appropriate number of flavor dice.
They roll the dice and look matching values. If there are no matching values, they discard a single die of their choice, then roll the pool again to continue cooking. When they get any number of matching values, players collect those dice off to the side and continue rolling. When they have only one die left, the meal is done.
Take each set of matched dice and add their values together. For example, a d6 and a d8 that rolled matching 3s would be worth 3. A d10 and d12 that rolled matching 4s would be worth 4. A d8 and a d20 that rolled matching 4s (on a different roll) would also be worth 4. Together, they have a Meal Rating of 11.

All PCs who eat the meal can individually use the value of the Meal Rating to clear Hit Points, clear Stress, and gain Hope, dividing this value however they’d like.

Anytime a party makes a dish with the same **flavor profile** as another recipe they’ve previously recorded in their cookbook, they should add a number of tokens equal to the party’s current tier to their pool of flavor dice.
When they must discard a die, they can instead discard one of these tokens.

A PC can hold a number of ingredients equal to the value of their highest character trait.
